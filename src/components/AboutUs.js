            We are senior year computer science students at Metropolitan State University.
            Space racer is our final project in our capstone class. We worked through it for
             approximately three months. We came up with this project, as we, as computer
              science students would like to possess a professional typing skill. Our goal was
               not just to provide a quality typing game that will boast one's typing speed
                and accuracy but also make the process super fun.
